I ended up not using Sails. I know it was part of the specs, but I could not get React+Webpack latest versions to work with latest version of Sails.
I used a regular Express instead. I know it is a derogation to spesc, but since the coding challenge is mainly about showcasing basic skills, I opted out for that solution instead.

Note also that builds are not optimized.

Cheers!
